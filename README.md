Creating documentation and an architecture overview for your API gateway is essential for clarity, maintenance, and onboarding new developers. Below is a structured way to document your API gateway project, along with a suggested architecture diagram.

### API Gateway Documentation

#### 1. Overview
The API Gateway is a microservices architecture component that acts as a single entry point for client requests. It handles routing, composition, and protocol translation, providing a unified interface for various backend services.

#### 2. Features
- **Service Registration**: Allows services to register themselves with the gateway, including their base paths and available methods.
- **Routing**: Forwards requests to the appropriate backend service based on the path and method.
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across multiple instances of a service to optimize resource usage and enhance performance.
- **Health Checks**: Monitors the health of backend services to ensure reliability.
- **Error Handling**: Returns appropriate HTTP status codes and messages for client requests.

#### 3. Architecture


- **Client**: The application or user making requests to the API Gateway.
- **API Gateway**: The central component that handles incoming requests.
  - **Route Handlers**: Logic to handle different routes.
  - **Service Registry**: A store of registered services with their base paths and instances.
  - **Load Balancer**: Distributes requests to service instances.
- **Service Instances**: Backend services that handle specific business logic (e.g., Service 1 running on `http://localhost:3001` and Service 2 on `http://localhost:3002`).
- **Database**: Optional component where services can persist data.

#### 4. Endpoints

- **GET /routes**
  - **Description**: Retrieves the list of registered services and their endpoints.
  - **Response**: JSON object containing service details.

- **POST /register**
  - **Description**: Registers a new service with the API Gateway.
  - **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "service1",
      "base_path": "/service1",
      "instances": [
        {
          "url": "http://localhost:3001",
          "methods": "GET"
        },
        {
          "url": "http://localhost:3002",
          "methods": "GET"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  - **Response**: Confirmation of registration.

- **GET /service1/hello**
  - **Description**: Example of a routed service call to the `/hello` endpoint of `service1`.
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Hello from services One"
    }
    ```

#### 5. Usage Example
```bash
# Register a new service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/register \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "name": "service1",
  "base_path": "/service1",
  "instances": [
    { "url": "http://localhost:3001", "methods": "GET" },
    { "url": "http://localhost:3002", "methods": "GET" }
  ]
}'

# Call the hello endpoint of service1
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/service1/hello
```

#### 6. Error Handling
- **404 Not Found**: Returned if a requested route is not registered.
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: Returned if an unsupported HTTP method is used.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Returned for unexpected server issues
